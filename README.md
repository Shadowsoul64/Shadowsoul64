- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shadowsoul64
- 👀 I’m interested in MegaMan, pokemon, analog tech and generally curious about how things work 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Python in order to automate tasks at work. I have also switched to linux on one pc to learn to use linux and eventually switch over completely. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet, but eventualy something once my skills improve!
- 📫 How to reach me - nowhere yet!
